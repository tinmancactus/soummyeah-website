Blogging is one of those things that I've always had good intentions of doing, but I just never really got around to... until now. If you're reading this, it's finally made it off the to-do list and into the real world.

## Why am I doing this?

Because I want to share my work. Because people might find it useful. Because it might open up some opportunities for me. 

Once I get things up and running, I hope that _So Umm Yeah_ will be a place where you can find:
- **Stories about my various projects**
- **Useful tools for education designers**
- **Tips and tricks for working smarter**
- **A showcase of my LXD work**

Anyway, that's all for now. Next time I'll have something more intersting to share, I promise!
